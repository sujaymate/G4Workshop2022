# 1st National Workshop on GEANT4 and its Application to High-Energy Physics and Astrophysics: Tutorial problems and solutions

This repository contains complete solutions to the tutorial problems given to the participants at the [_1st National Workshop on GEANT4 and its Application to High-Energy Physics and Astrophysics_](https://indico.tifr.res.in/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=8511). There are currently three tutorials, one about GEANT4 application to high-energy particle physics collider experiments and two about GEANT4 application to space-based astrophysics detectors. The problem statement for each problem can be found inside the individual directory. One line summary for each problem is as follows:

`HGCal_tutorial`: Simulating high-granularity Silicon detectors for collider experiments.

`CZT_tutorial`: Simulating spectral response of Cadmium Zinc Telluride X/gamma-ray detectors.

`ScatPol_tutorial`: Simulating scattering X-ray polarimeter using scintillator detectors.
